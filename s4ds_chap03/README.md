# Chapter 3: Plotting with breeze-viz

We introduce the breeze-viz library for two-dimensional plots. We will base some of the examples on the same height-weight data introduced in chapter 2.

 * `HWData.scala`: Routines to help load the height-weight data from CSVs.
 * `BreezeDemo.scala`: Example code for plotting simple x-y plots, scatter plots (including scatter plots with variable point size and color), as well as multiple plots on one figure.
 * `ScatterplotMatrix.scala` contains a class for plotting [scatterplot matrices](http://www.utexas.edu/courses/schwab/sw388r7/Tutorials/IllustrationofRegressionAnalysis_doc_html/024_The_Scatterplot_Matrix.html). Run `ScatterPlotMatrixDemo` to see this in action.
